# MonkeyMind
My daily log questionaire, made into a digital format.

I'm planning on turning this into a react+redux project to teach myself how to build scalable systems in a proper way that can interact with API's to the apps and services I use on the daily. This is meant to be sort of a dashboard of all the things I use, my thoughts are to start small scale to begin with, and work my way from there.
Hopefully it won't be too painful.. but then again, there are always new shiny JS libraries on the horizon..
More tests will be comming up shortly..


## Milestones:
* Basic interface and functionality
* Connect with database to make entries stick around
* Integrate with google Calendar API to schedule daily events
* Integrate with google tasks and add to-do's to list
* Integrate with Trello, translating the to-do's to a viewable card on a board
